    <p>Translated from Latin and adapted by Laura Kelley of The Silk Road Gourmet, Ancient Roman Pork with Apples is a way to use leftover pork. It calls for defrutum, grape juice that has been boiled down and made into a syrup, which was a common sweetener used in that time. It seems to be an example of the sweet and savory combo that Herbert spoke about. Kelley says the recipe "balances sweet, sour, salty and bitter" and the "unami factor is through the roof."</p>
